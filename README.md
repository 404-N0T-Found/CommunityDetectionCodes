# CommunityDetectionCodes
Locality-Based Overlapping Community Detection Algorithms. 
And I recommend you to use jetbrains' ide namely clion, pycharm and intellij to 
read related codes. 

I also write a community-detection survey in [Survey](Survey), you can have a look, if interested.

##Attention
These codes are all research codes, which I found through the internet. Please do not use them in production enviroment.
